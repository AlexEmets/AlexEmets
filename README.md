Hello! I'm Oleksandr!


I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong interest in Web3 technology. I have experience in modern C++ and Rust, working on Blockchain, IoT, and high-frequency trading (HFT) projects. I've implemented decentralized oracles and developed smart contract solutions on the ICP blockchain. I'm also expanding my knowledge and skills in blockchain development, focusing on smart contracts and decentralized applications.
